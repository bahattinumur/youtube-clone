<h1>YOUTUBE CLONE</h1>

I have created a YouTube clone using Vite + React, Axios, and React Router DOM, fetching data from RapidAPI. The styles were implemented with Tailwind CSS, and React Icons library was used for icons. This modern combination of libraries and the Tailwind CSS framework provides a user experience similar to the original YouTube page.
